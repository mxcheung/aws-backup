In AWS Backup, you can use ARNs to specify the resources to be backed up. When you want to back up a specific folder within an S3 bucket, you can use an ARN with a prefix to denote the folder. However, as of the latest AWS updates, AWS Backup does not support direct prefix-based selections for S3. It supports backing up entire S3 buckets.

To handle folder-specific backups within an S3 bucket, you might need to implement a more customized approach, such as using AWS Lambda or another method to copy specific objects to a dedicated bucket or prefix that is then backed up.
